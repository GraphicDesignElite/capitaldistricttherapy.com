<h3 class="h4">Individual Therapy</h3>
<p>You arrive at my office, when you first walk in there’s a waiting area where you are welcomed to have a seat. I will come to greet you and we will step into my office. We have paperwork to complete, I will review everything with you and make sure you understand and feel comfortable with all of the information. The paperwork includes confidentiality, informed consent and HIPAA notice of practices, very similar to the kind of stuff you fill out at a doctor’s office. Then we begin by discussing what brought you in. I will also ask questions about various aspects of your life, answer any questions you may have and we will get to know each other.</p>

<h3 class="h4">Child Therapy - Child</h3>
<p>I practice play therapy with children under age of 12. That means my office has many therapeutic toys including a sand tray, house, and people figurines, which children play with. The child chooses the toys and items that they will interact with while I observe their play themes. Sometimes children will ask me to join in play and I will get right in there with them. I also have art supplies that provide another medium for children to express. </p>
<p>For those talkative individuals from age 8 and up I tell them about the forms of therapy: talk therapy, art therapy, therapeutic writing & play therapy, and allow them to choose their path. Most often teenagers utilize a combination of mediums. </p>
